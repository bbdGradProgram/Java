# Java Bean Journey Server
## BBD Grad Program | Java Level Up

Welcome to the Bean Escape Text-Based Game Server repository for the BBD Grad Program Java Level Up!

This server is part of a collaborative project involving four developers over a two-week period. The goal is to build a client-server architecture in Java, connecting to a database to manage information about game states and transitions for the "Bean Escape" game. In this game, players assume the role of a brave bean attempting to escape from the clutches of the BBD chef.

### To run the server locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FreeTheBeans/java-bean-server.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   mvn install

4. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   java -jar /target/server.<version>.jar

Once the server is running, clients can connect to it using the API to help the bean escape from the palms of the chef.

### Features:

- Manages game state and interactions between players and the game world.
- Stateless client-server architecture.
- RESTful API.
